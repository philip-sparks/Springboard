Example Code from Data Science Assignments

This folder will contain assignment data for
Springboard DS CT.

## Getting Started

Still learning how to fully utilize READMEs.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Anaconda

Jupyter Notebook

#### JSON exercise

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,

Find the 10 countries with most projects

Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')

In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
