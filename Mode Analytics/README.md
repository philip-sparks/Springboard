#### The problem - Investigating a Drop in User Engagement from pseudo-Yammer Analytics

Ideas for causes in the drop include:

1. Seasonal/holiday drops

2. New software leaves some users without access

3. One off events like ad campaigns, loss of customer relationship, or sudden shutdown of services





##### Answer the following:

Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?

If so, what are they and how will you test them?

If they are questions that you canâ€™t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?

What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?

What, if anything, should the company do in response?
