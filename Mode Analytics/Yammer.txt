The problem - Investigating a Drop in User Engagement from pseudo-Yammer Analytics

Ideas for causes in the drop include:

1. Seasonal/holiday drops

2. New software leaves some users without access

3. One off events like ad campaigns, loss of customer relationship, or sudden shutdown of services

Answer the following:

Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?

Most of these causes for a drop could be discovered by finding the right person at Yammer to discuss
this with and determine if anything unexpected has occurred in the last month.

You could ask any of the following people about drops in user engagement, based on their job title:
Product Manager - Have there been any new releases in software since 7/28?
Marketing - Did any ad campaigns or promotional events end on 7/28?
Sales - Did any contracts with certain customers on 7/28?
Sys. Admin - Were there any expected/unexpected shutdowns of services that would have unexpectedly
caused a loss of access?

If so, what are they and how will you test them?

Look at user engagement dip by country and see if it aligns with the hypothesis that users in the US
are taking vacation.

If they are questions that you canâ€™t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, 
assuming you actually worked at this company)?

What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?

US workers going on vacation.

What, if anything, should the company do in response (in order of importance)?

1. Determine how to increase the clickthrough rate on emails. This correlates to the dip seen on 7/28 as well.
2. Increase and diversify worldwide user engagement
3. Wait for September data to confirm (if it picks up to July levels, you'll know the cause is seasonal).
